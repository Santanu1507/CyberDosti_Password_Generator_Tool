# Password Generator App

The Password Generator App is a simple graphical application built using Python's tkinter library. It allows users to generate random passwords of a specified length and displays them along with associated usernames. The app also provides options to accept or reject generated passwords and to generate new ones if needed.

## Features

- Generate random passwords with customizable lengths.
- Display generated passwords along with associated usernames.
- Option to accept or reject generated passwords.
- Ability to generate new passwords if the user rejects the previous ones.
- User-friendly interface with input fields and buttons.

## Requirements

To use the Password Generator App, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The tkinter library (usually included in the standard Python library).

## Usage

### Installation:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Running the App:

Execute the Python script.

python password_generator_app.py

## Using the App

1. The Password Generator App window will appear.

2. **Enter User Name**: Input the desired username.

3. **Password Length**: Specify the length of the password you want to generate.

4. Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password.

5. The generated password will be displayed along with the username.

6. You can choose to accept or reject the password using the "Accept Password" or "Reject Password" buttons.

7. If you reject the password, a new password will be generated automatically, and you can repeat the accept or reject process.

## Example

Suppose you want to generate a password for a user named "JohnDoe" with a password length of 12 characters. Follow these steps:

1. Enter "JohnDoe" in the "Enter User Name" field.

2. Enter "12" in the "Enter Password Length" field.

3. Click on the "Generate Password" button.

4. A random password will be displayed, such as "4zP$1a2T@J8b".

5. You can choose to accept or reject this password using the "Accept Password" or "Reject Password" buttons.

6. If you reject the password, a new password will be generated automatically.

## Customization

The Password Generator App is a basic implementation. You can customize and enhance the application based on your specific requirements. For instance:

- Modify the appearance by changing the font, button colors, and layout.
- Add more complexity to the password generation algorithm (e.g., including/excluding specific characters).
- Implement additional password-related features such as password strength indicators, password saving, etc.
- Enhance error handling to handle edge cases and invalid inputs.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to suit your needs.
